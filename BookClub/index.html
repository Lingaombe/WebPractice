                            When a body is discovered by local police, all fingers point to Mada who is
                            allegedly the last person to come in contact with the deceased.<br>
                            As the investigation is solely focusing on her, Mada's friends realise
                            the real murderer is about to get away free of consequence.<br>
                            With the tact of a deer caught in headlights, the girls embark 
                            on their most dangerous adventure yet: chasing after a deranged lunatic.<br>
                            But sometimes a big bucket of hope just doesn't cut it.

                            No one prepares you for the moment you lose your spouse.<br>
                            Everyone looks on with sympathetic eyes, pitying your existance.<br>
                            No one prepares you for the unsolicited hugs and the "Stay strong"s
                            that seem to follow your every step like a shadow.<br>
                            But I was starting to cope, I was starting to move on<br>
                            That is until the detectives showed up<br>
                            "Miss Ngweru, you are under arrest."

                            She parties all night on new year's eve then wakes up 
                            with no recollection of what happened the previous year.
                            What's worse, no one seems to remember or realise they 
                            have forgotten.<br> 
                            As if that weren't chilling enough, she finds a crumbled piece 
                            of paper in her drawer with her squiggly handwriting
                            "square hour glass resets time"
