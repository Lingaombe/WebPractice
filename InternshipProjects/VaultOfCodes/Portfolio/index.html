                        <p>
                            This is an e-commerce mockup project. The idea was to create a website that would allow users to buy and sell products. The website is called Pamsika which is the Chichewa word for market. The website is a work in progress.

                        <p>
                            The idea for this website came from a prompt on <a href="https://goodbrief.io" target="_blank">goodbrief.io</a>. The idea was to create a website for a condo realtor company called ROOT that has a large selection of condos to rent and sale all over the country. This website made it to this portfolio because it is the first website I ever made after learning about RWD (Responsive Website Design).

                        <p>
                            One of the first websites I ever made before I got a laptop. I was just getting started with html, css and javascript and thought it would be a good idea to automatically get hairstyles picked for me. As a 4c hair gurlie there are so many hairstyles I could do that it gives me decision paralysis. So this is my solution to a not so serious problem I had.

                            This project was made with the threejs framework as a basic intro to the framework. It's a solar system based project with the Moon, Earth and Mars. It is a 3D, non-official version of my portfolio. It is also when I officially started using git
