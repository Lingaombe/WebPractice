# 🌐 webPractice

This repo is my **web dev playground** 🎉
It contains random practice files, experiments, and code snippets as I explore **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.

## 🛠 What’s Inside

* 📝 Basic HTML structure tests
* 🎨 CSS styling experiments (layouts, grids, flexbox, animations)
* ⚡ JavaScript snippets & DOM manipulation practice
* 🔗 Small mini-projects & random web ideas

## 🚧 Note

This repo is **not organized** and not meant for production — just a place to dump and play with ideas 🚀
